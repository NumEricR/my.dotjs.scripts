# About this repository

You will find here some scripts I've created for my own needs. Feel free to use them if you need :)

My scripts have been successfully tested on FF / Mac OS.


## About dotjs

dotjs is a Google Chrome extension created by defunkt that executes JavaScript files in `~/.js` based on their filename.

If you navigate to `http://www.google.com/`, dotjs will execute `~/.js/google.com.js` and `~/.js/default.js` is loaded on every request.

You can find more informations on [defunkt's dotjs repository](https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs).
